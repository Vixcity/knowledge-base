狂人尼采说的：“凡不能毁灭我的，必使我强大。”

人生的征程中，先是恐惧驱动，地狱震颤了你，想要逃离黑暗深渊；后来才是愿望驱动，星空吸引了你，想要征服星辰大海。

“心智” 这两个字合在一起是一个意思，分开为 “心” 和 “智” 两个字又可以分别解释为：**“心” 是你对需要的选择，从心出发；“智” 是对价值的判断，智力的匹配**。

比完美更重要的是先完成。

时间如流水，从我们的指缝间悄悄流走；如轻烟，被微风吹散了；如薄雾，被初阳蒸融了

**有共性的回忆趋向粘合在一起，标志性的回忆倾向于鹤立鸡群**

**我会记下一年来经历的所有有意义的事件（除去每日的例行工作），我称之为 “时间日志**《奇特的一生》

 **过去的你也许不曾是时间的旧爱，但未来的你可以成为时间的新欢。**

人无癖不可与交，以其无深情也。明朝散文家张岱《陶庵梦忆》

一直花时间求学，也许是为了拖延人生做决定的时间。

本杰明·富兰克林是这么说的： 要么写点值得读的东西，要么做点值得写的事情。

第一最好不相见，如此便可不相恋。 　
第二最好不相知，如此便可不相思。 　
第三最好不相伴，如此便可不相欠。 　
第四最好不相惜，如此便可不相忆。 　　
第五最好不相爱，如此便可不相弃。 　
第六最好不相对，如此便可不相会。 　
第七最好不相误，如此便可不相负。 　
第八最好不相许，如此便可不相续。 
第九最好不相依，如此便可不相偎。 　
第十最好不相遇，如此便可不相聚。	——仓央嘉措

欲望是止不住的，压不下的，那不是欲望，而是无知。

每一个你所浪费的今天，都是昨天是逝去的人曾经奢望过的明天。每一个你所厌烦的现在，都是未来的你想回也回不去的曾经。

对于可控的事情，我们要保持谨慎，对于不可控的事情，我们要保持乐观

西内卡还说过：“并非困难使我们放弃，而是因为我们放弃，才显得如此困难”

老子说道‘天下难事必做于易，天下大事必做于细’

[《不要温和地走进那个良夜》](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E4%B8%8D%E8%A6%81%E6%B8%A9%E5%92%8C%E5%9C%B0%E8%B5%B0%E8%BF%9B%E9%82%A3%E4%B8%AA%E8%89%AF%E5%A4%9C/8670983?fr=aladdin)

Do not go gentle into that good night,

Old age should burn and rave at close of day;

Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,

Because their words had forked no lightning they

Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright

Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,

Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,

And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,

Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight

Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,

Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on the sad height,

Curse, bless me now with your fierce tears, I pray.

Do not go gentle into that good night.

Rage, rage against the dying of the light.


[《我喜欢你是寂静的》](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%88%91%E5%96%9C%E6%AC%A2%E4%BD%A0%E6%98%AF%E5%AF%82%E9%9D%99%E7%9A%84/45167?fr=aladdin)

I like for you to be still

It is as though you are absent

And you hear me from far away

And my voice does not touch you

It seems as though your eyes had flown away

And it seems that a kiss had sealed your mouth

As all things are filled with my soul

You emerge from the things

Filled with my soul

You are like my soul

A butterfly of dream

And you are like the word: Melancholy

I like for you to be still

And you seem far away

It sounds as though you are lamenting

A butterfly cooing like a dove

And you hear me from far away

And my voice does not reach you

Let me come to be still in your silence

And let me talk to you with your silence

That is bright as a lamp

Simple, as a ring

You are like the night

With its stillness and constellations

Your silence is that of a star

As remote and candid

I like for you to be still

It is as though you are absent

Distant and full of sorrow

So you would've died

One word then,

One smile is enough And I'm happy;

Happy that it's not true
